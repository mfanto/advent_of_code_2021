# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2021

The Advent of Code challege have always been an opportunity for me to try a new language. The problems are difficult, but not impossible. I find each challenge also inadvertently introduces me to a new concept in the language, further helping me explore topics and best practices.

Back in 2016 I learned the [F# language with the Advent of Code Challenge](https://github.com/mfanto/advent-of-code-fsharp). This year, I decided to learn Rust.

## :calendar: Calendar

## :runner: Running

In each directory

```
	$ rustc main.rs
	$ ./main
```

Every solution above should produce the correct answer, with the associated input file.
